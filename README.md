## Dependencies
The only language used was Python 3 with a virtualenv -- all the installed packages in the virtualenv are listed in `list_of_installed_packages.txt`
(Most of these are probably unnecessary except for scikit-learn and numpy/scipy.)


## Getting started
All you need to do is load up a virtualenv with all the packages listed above, and then run the two included notebooks.
